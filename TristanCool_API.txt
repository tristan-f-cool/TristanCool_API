Hello World,

This is my master API I use for all my Arduino and Raspberry Pi prototypes.
I have created SDK's and PCB's with my own design blocks, libraries and classes.
I have read-me files and release records for each section of this work.
My intent is to use these programs to rapidly create any project I could ever need!
